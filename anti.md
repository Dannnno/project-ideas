# Anti project


## The user and a language
This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.

Doing laundry

### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help 
them?_

Doing laundry is such a pain.  No one enjoys doing it.  It takes a lot of work
sorting everything by material and color, and then actually washing, drying,
folding and then putting away your clothes is a pain (not to mention things that
have to be ironed and/or hung up).  This helps people who don't like doing 
laundry, but not really.  

You can think of how to do laundry as one set of rules that could be globally
applied to all laundry.  It doesn't take writing a new program to do laundry
in a different home - just a robot that knows the rules.


### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_

A language is appropriate because it lets you be very expressive about what
sort of things should be washed/dryed/post-processed in what way, and what sort
of detergents and such, etc.

This isn't appropriate because a single app can handle all of this - just 
provide a config file.

### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_

This excites me because I hate laundry.  I came up with it because I realized
it's a boring task I want to automate, which means I could write a program for 
it but it probably doesn't deserve a language.


### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._

Streamlining the laundry process


### Interface (syntax)
_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look 
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_ 

They interact with the language by writing out all of the steps required, in 
order, for each type of clothes (can be separated by color, material, etc).

Programming looks like doing all the sorting work of laundry up front while
writing the program, and then actually doing all of the sorting work for real.

This is the wrong way to interact with the problem domain because of unnecessary 
repetition.


### Operation (semantics)
_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_

A program runs when the laundry is run.  It interacts with the user the same way
a washer and dryer do.  Errors occur if you mess up your laundry by mixing 
colors and materials, or using the wrong settings, etc.


### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_

It should be easy to do laundry.  It should be possible to do laundry well. It 
should be impossible to not do laundry.

### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well 
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_

No, because this is silly.


## The Project
This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.


### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_

You'd have to spend the whole time on the language part because there is no
systems aspect except following the instructinos on your list.


### Scope
_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_

This is pointless and small.


### Benefits and drawbacks
_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea 
project?_

It isn't a good idea.
